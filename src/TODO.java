    /*
    CURRENT TODO'S
    - Change all club and person values into arrays. initialize them with the #sample points as size
        - Necessary for easy data collecting: add all variable values at the correct time to respective arrays
        - Sample points is ((closing time - opening time) / time increment
        - Requires initialisations to be altered as well: fill only the first index of each array
        - Also requires the get and set methods to allow alterations of any array index
    - Implement actual variable changing over time in UpdateDay(), see if array correctly filled at end of the day
    - Test bringing the values over to Matlab via RoundUpDay(): can be done with or without added time-stamps
    - Look into and add simple visualisation of club and persons inside over time
        - Could we save these visualisations as pictures? Would then be possible to make a video out of
    - Add meaningfull logic and relations between all first phase variables
    - Test until reasonable results are achieved
